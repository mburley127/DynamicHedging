# Dynamic Delta Hedging Strategy in Commodities Markets
This repository contains implementations of various hedging models in Python. The models included are:

1. **Dynamic Delta Hedging Model**

  - `DynamicHedging`: Contains the implementation of the Direct Hedging model.

This project explores the implementation of a dynamic hedging strategy in the commodities market using the Black 76 model. The strategy involves continuously adjusting the hedge position to maintain a delta-neutral portfolio, thereby reducing risk and stabilizing returns. By recalculating delta and adjusting hedge positions at each time step, we aim to mitigate the volatility of commodities prices. The effectiveness of this strategy is evaluated against unhedged positions based on performance metrics such as total returns, annualized returns, mean returns, standard deviation, and the Sharpe ratio. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing risk management and return stabilization in commodities trading.

2. **Results**

  - `results`: Contains the complete write-up and full comparative analysis of results.

This directory includes the detailed results and analysis of the dynamic hedging model. It provides insights into the performance metrics such as total returns, percentage returns, mean returns, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of the hedging strategy.
